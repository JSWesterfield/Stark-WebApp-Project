# Stark-WebApp-Project ![alt text](https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/SUPERVISTA/graphics/png/400/palette.png ==100x20)
Web Application for 'stark' client.


## Developed an application using the four basic functions of persistent storage(CRUD). 
Allows user to 'locate' entities within the application and use as a social tool for gaining 
widespread interest in a topic that might other wise be considered to the mainstream boring. We've(me and other developers)used this app
as a way to use social interaction to increase the interest within a certain topic/industry. Again a lot of this sounds rather cryptic 
due to not being able to disclose details about the project prior to the deployment.
